      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Rebirth Island was founded in 2022 by Oyegbola Mayowa, a design
        enthusiast with a vision to challenge the status quo and break into the
        wearable art industry. Our journey began in Lagos, Nigeria. Where we
        started designing and producing small batches of clothing for friends
        and family.
        <br />
        <br /> As word spread, our community grew, and so did our passion for
        creating meaningful, wearable art. Today, we're growing proud to be a
        part of's the nationâ€™s vibrant fashion scene.
